/**
 * /hr/employee/tasks — the employee's own task surface.
 *
 * Visually consistent with the rest of /hr/employee/* (PageHeader + Card
 * shell). The heavy lifting is done by <TaskList scope="mine"> which:
 *   - fetches tasks the user is the assignee OR creator of
 *   - shows the "Today / Overdue / Upcoming / Someday / Done" buckets
 *   - opens TaskDrawer for click → which now respects the creator/assignee
 *     permission lattice (Start/End for assignees, full edit for creators,
 *     attachments + comments for both)
 *
 * Why a dedicated page when /tasks already exists? Two reasons:
 *   1. The employee sidebar already lives under /hr/employee/*; jumping to
 *      a top-level /tasks broke the breadcrumb context.
 *   2. Employees were filtering through their own admin-flavoured /tasks
 *      view and getting confused. Same component, scoped + framed.
